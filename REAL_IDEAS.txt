POOP STICK UPGRADES
- Crafting recipe changes from needing bedrock to some other hard-to-obtain block
- The idea is that if we're going to have an OP weapon, there must be an insane drawback
- Instakills enemies but either saps your health at a constant rate whenever its in your inventory or it leaves you on half a heart after every use

BLOCKS
-Buried Floppy Fragment (ore)
-Compooter

FLOPPY FRAGMENTS
- Buried Floppy Fragment ores generate underground rarely in dirt
- Block drops itself when broken
- Ore block can be right-clicked with a shovel (cleaning the dirt off) to drop Floppy Fragment
- 8 Floppy Fragments surrounding a Redstone Dust in a crafting table creates Old Floppy Disc
- The sound the floppy has on it will be assigned when it's crafted, at random, pulled from the pool of all floppy disc sounds
- Discs with different sounds cannot stack

COMPOOTER
- A block representing an old computer with a floppy disc drive
- Can be right-clicked with an Old Floppy Disc to play the disc's contents
- Essentially a jukebox for Old Floppy Discs instead of Music Discs
